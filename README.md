# Password Compromise Checker 🛡️🔑
Password Compromise Checker is a user-friendly desktop application built with Python and Tkinter. It helps users determine whether their password has been compromised in known data breaches using the Have I Been Pwned API.

# Features ✨

Simple UI: A clean and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) created with Tkinter, opening centered on the screen for easy access. 🖥️
Password Hashing: Uses SHA-1 hashing to securely check password compromise. 🔒
Real-Time Results: Fetches and displays real-time results from the Have I Been Pwned API. ⏱️
Error Handling: Provides informative messages for network errors and input issues. ⚠️

# How It Works 🔍

Input: Users enter their password into the GUI. ✍️
Processing: The application hashes the password and sends a request to the Have I Been Pwned API to check if the hashed password has been compromised. 🕵️‍♂️
Output: Displays the number of times the password has been compromised or informs the user if the password is safe. ✅❌
